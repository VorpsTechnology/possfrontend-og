        We are Poss India,  an undertaking by The Rolling Groomers, that makes all your pet needs possible. As pet parents ourselves, we are acutely aware of the need to buy the right products for them, and the benefits of regular, careful grooming. And we are here to offer you just that; affordable pet care for your quadruped children.
The Rolling Groomers started their journey in 2021, providing grooming services on the go from a van. It proved incredibly popular among pet owners, and gave us the confidence to expand into a physical store with Poss India. Here we offer the same level of quality and care, only with a wider range of products and services to choose from.
